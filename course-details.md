Learn JMeter by doing and with the help of GitHub Learning Bot ðŸ¤–. This course covers how to design JMeter test plans for performance testing and more.

Over the duration of this course, you interact with the GitHub Learning bot which makes learning fun and effective.

# What you will learn?

In this course, the bot will teach you the following:

* Creating first JMeter test plan
* HTTP Sampler

# How this course works?

This course follows GitHub's 3 phase approach:

* Instruct
* Observe
* Feedback

*Instruct* is the phase where you will get the set of instructions from the bot (in the form of issues and markdown files). You have to follow the instructions as is and pull the file to the repository.

*Observe* is the phase where the bot will look for your response. Once you complete the activity, the bot will validate and respond.

*Feedback* is the phase where the bot will respond to your response. Bot will tell you what to do next, or any feedback.
